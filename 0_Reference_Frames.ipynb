While these are useful (images pixels are defined in a 2d coordinate system), they are relatively straight-forward and not worth much discussion. When working with orbital sensor models, the more interesting topic is working with measurements in 3D reference frames."

All rectangular 3D coordinate systems can be split into 2 groups, right handed and left handed. All right handed coordinate systems can be rotated into each other and all left handed coordinate systems can be rotated into each other, but no right handed coordinate system can be rotated into a left handed coordinate system and visa-versa. A long time ago, a bunch of right handed people decided that everything should operate in right handed coordinate systems and, for the most part, the convention has stuck."
