Rotations are non-commutative, which means the order you do them in matters. So, if you rotate about the X-axis by 90 degrees and then the Z-axis by 90 degrees, you will get a different rotation than if you rotate about the Z-axis by 90 degrees and then the X-axis by 90 degrees. Euler angles are a series of rotations about axes, but there is no convention for what order you rotate around the axes in, or even which axes you rotate about. **If you're working with Euler angles always be aware of what your axis order is!**"
