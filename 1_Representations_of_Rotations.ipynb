    "### What are quaternions?\n",
    "If you don't know what quaternions are, then you can think about them as complex numbers except instead of just i, you also get j and k. For example, $1+0.5i+2j+3k$ is a quaternion, so is $3+0i+2.3j+4k$. When representation rotations, unit quaternions are usually used. This is because scaling a quaternion by a constant doesn't change the rotation it represents. So, $1+0.5i+2j+3k$ represents the same rotation as $2+1i+4j+6k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do quaternions represent rotations?\n",
    "Due to some interesting properties of [quaternion maultiplication](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348a-17-winter/Papers/quaternion.pdf), we can represent a rotation around a unit length axis $(x,y,z)$ by $\\theta$ with the following quaternion $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)(xi + yj + zk)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's nifty and all but how do we actually use it? Let's say we have some quaternion $q$ that represents a rotation and we want to rotate a vector $(a,b,c)$ by that rotation. The way we do that is by first converting $(a,b,c)$ into the pure quaternion $0+ai+bj+ck$, then we multiply it on the left by $q$ and on the right by $q^{-1}$, the inverse of $q$. This produces another pure quaternion $0+a^\\prime i+b^\\prime j+c^\\prime k = q(0+ai+bj+ck)q^{-1}$ and our rotated vector is simply $(a^\\prime,b^\\prime,c^\\prime)$. Computing the right side of that equals sign by hand can be rather tedious, but thankfully it's just a bit of addition and multiplication, so computers can do it quite quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some other perks of quaternions?\n",
    "* Computing a rotation matrices from a quaternion requires **0** trig functions.\n",
    "* Every rotation is represented by exactly 2 quaternions, $q$ and $-q$.\n",
    "* The space of unit quaternions is a 4 dimensional sphere, so they interpolate nicely.\n",
    "* They are relatively compact, only 4 floating point values need to be stored.\n",
    "* They chain together easily; to rotate by two quaternions, you simply rotate by the product of the quaternions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some problems with quaternions?\n",
    "* They are abstract; it is hard to intuitively understand how a quaternion rotates a given vector.\n",
    "* Rotating a vector by a quaternion takes more operations than rotating a vector by a rotation matrix.\n",
    "* Libraries are inconsistent about ordering quaternions; some use $w +xi + yj + zk$ (SPICE) and others use $xi + yj + zk + w$ (scipy)"
